That's the short story for the newbies: in 2022, the hacker group LAPSUS$ shared screenshots on Telegram, showing they had accessed Okta's internal data.

After that, Okta denied all that and stated that it was just “unsuccessful attempt”. But only a few days later, Todd McKinnon (CEO) confirmed the breach on his Twitter.

After all that, not only direct customers were hurt, but their investors as well (obviously). And now they decided to resolve it with investors at least by paying $60M.

So, if you were an investor back then, you can check if you're eligible and file for the [payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/okta-investor-settlement).

1718668325.0,DNS queries resolving to Russian-hosted CDNs,"I'm based in the UK and using ControlD as a DNS filtering system. I have a simple config, and one of the rules is in large terms ""block domains that resolve to IPs belonging to Russia"".

Starting yesterday I noticed large portions of the Internet not working correctly for me - such as LinkedIn, the CDN of SkyNews, some O365 and even some Apple services. After lots of digging I noticed they're all blocked by ControlD's policy I've set as resolving to RU. It can't be I said - must be a glitch with Control D.

Top domains include some concerning ones:

* r3.o.lencr.org
* \*.dscq.akami.net
* apps.identrust.com
* amp-api-edge.apps.apple.com
* gspe19-2-ssl.ls.apple.com
* ced.sascdn.com
* ctldl.windowsupdate.com
* identity.nel.measure.office.net
* static.licdn.com
* statics.teams.cdn.office.net and many others.

Running a quick dig and traceroute most of this traffic is actually resolving via Google DNS, Cloudflare and a few others to IP addresses hosted by Rostelecom. Requests seem to be  resolved by CDNs with a preference for Russia for a number of CDNs and I can't think of a good reason for this. I have reached to Control D user community for initial sanity check and I have found a few other users reporting the same behaviour.

I initially suspected Akamai moved some blocks of IPs from Russia to EU and geo-location was not updated - which does happen every once in a while - but I can actually see BGP routing still advertising the Rostelecom AS numbers for a number of these addresses.

For reference this is one ""landing"" IP range - [https://bgp.tools/prefix/2.16.53.0/24](https://bgp.tools/prefix/2.16.53.0/24)

1718681587.0,Yet another question about Master's Degree,"I know this topic is saturated, I do feel like mine is a bit unique compared to others, but I'm sure everyone feels that way. Apologies for the long post; TLDR: active duty officer, looking good/efficient. route to become fortune 500 CIO in future

I'm currently an active duty Naval Officer, working as the lead cyber security assessor and department head, which conducts cybersecurity training and assessments on Navy commands. My long term goal is to become a fortune 500 CIO and though I think that's an achievable goal, I know that will take some time. Additionally, I will be separating next year because I believe it would be beneficial for my goal to get civilian experience after 10 years of service.

My short term goal is make efficient use of my next few years to set me up correctly for my long term goal. This includes utilizing my GI bill to obtains a masters (I'm an academic at heart and would love a PhD, or doctorate, but I don't believe this field has any desire for that), and applying to a job that lines up well with future goal. My choices are [SANS.edu](http://SANS.edu) masters or some well established cyber masters program like UC Berkeley, but I open to any path that I haven't considered. I'd like to pursue a masters because it's basically a ""free"" post-graduate degree, and the I believe I can balance the work load.

My concerns (I'll start with the bad since I'm nervous about the future, but hopefully it's not as bad as I think):

- Being a naval officer, I haven't been technical since college. While I understand the concepts, I'm no where near as good at programming, and project management as I was 10 years ago. I'm afraid my lack of expertise will be a deterrent for fortune 500 companies.

- The Navy, and DOD network (DISA), is very different than civilian networks. I pray this isn't too big of a gap between civilian networks and deters employers from wanting to hire me.

- If I were to stay in, theoretically, I'd be looking at around 170k where I live (Southern California), and I'd like to make around that. I wouldn't mind taking a pay cut while I'm learning the nuances of the new industry, but I'm very uneducated about this aspect.

My redeeming features (lol):

- I have a lot of leadership experience, and regularly act as an intermediary between technical and executive teams. (Lots of experience from Cyber Assessments and previous job)

- I have a bachelors in Applied Physics and Computer Science, so I would actually be pretty happy if I had the opportunity to be hands on, even just as an intermediary immersion experience in the new industry.

- While DoDIN networks are different, I'm familiar with the non-vendor specific cyber security concepts from my certs like CISSP, PenTest, and PMP.

- If I decide to work for a company that would like me to have a higher degree, I have the GI bill in my back pocket which (maybe?) is an incentive to higher me.

Regarding my connudrum of which program I should look into, I'm worried if a place like UC Berkeley would even want me. I had 3.5+ gpa from UCSC, 10 years of experience from the Navy, and a bunch of certs, but I haven't taken the GRE/GMAT. 

Thank you for any advice, I really do appreciate any insight anyone could offer, and definitely open to new routes that I haven't listed.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dih43h/yet_another_question_about_masters_degree/,2

1718714603.0,Interesting Spearphishing Tactic,"Awareness and/or intel request…

We have seen a couple attempts at this now, and I’m curious if others have experienced the same. Phishers are creating a mock email exchange between CEO and CFO outlining a major financial decision. It is formatted perfectly (like a multi- part email thread), and of course includes appropriate names and contact info in footers—it is convincing. The two reach an agreement in the email exchange. Phishers then forward the fake email to a second-tier member of the finance team (Accounts Payable, if possible), spoofing one of the executive’s email accounts, instructing him/her to implement said decision.

Out of curiosity, I used two prompts in ChatGPT last night and created almost the same email, including formatting.

1718654066.0,Can malware access your bank and steal your money? It feels unlikely.,"I usually read on reddit how links can be dangerous. That's true but i also read how they gonna steal all your money. This part seems little exaggerate. Like with random link in email i would download malware that's gonna steal all my money from bank account? I would understand ""scam call"" where the victim would send the money or stealing credit card info. But i don't understand malware getting access to bank. Posts about that feels little unrealistic.

Let me explain:

1. In my country every bank has mobile banking app that's used for approving payments and access. You always need phone. Every bank has 2FA. Its default. You must have smartphone. (There are actually special accounts for people without mobile but those are limited in options. You have lower limits. Not every bank has this type of account. Its not standart. You need to specifically ask bank for that.) There is no SMS login in normal bank. You always need to accept login in mobile app with fingerprint.
2. Every time you want send money or change settings you need to accept it on your app with fingerprint. If you want for example send money to ten people you need to accept it ten times with your fingerprint.
3. In case you lost your access you need to go to the bank personally. There is no easy ""i forgot password option."" (Actually nowadays at least in my bank, there is option to get access to bank from home but you need to record your voice, record your face, record your id card, pretty long process. Also I'm not sure if this option would work in case of different phone)
4. If you buy new phone you could transfer your bank. But you need access to your old phone, otherwise point three apply.
5. You have only few attempts with password. Otherwise locked account and point three apply.
6. There are other security measure. Like app have access to your location and if anything unusual happen your bank call you. (It actually happened to me, i just wanted to buy something with debit card but it was foreign website and bank called me if i really want to approve my payment.)

Those are pretty standart points. Its not my bank specific. Even my dad, ten years ago when there wasn't mobile banking. He still had some physical key with totp. And he still needed to use that number every time he wanted to buy anything or change anything in his bank account.

Its seems extremely unlikely. Especially if you are not some high value target. I personally heard about three people who lost money. Two times it was stolen credit card info and one time scam call. Never stolen bank account, but from some news on reddit. It sound like there are malwares that attack bank accounts. I never studied security. **I'm just curious if those post really exaggerate or I'm missing something.** Because attacker would need to get access to phone with some malware, steal your fingerprint and then redirect the call from bank. Those steps seems possible but really unlikely. I just don't get it.

Sorry if that's wrong subreddit. I don't know where to ask, but i thinking about that for past days.

1718550630.0,Seeking Help with DDoS Mitigation for Streaming Platform Using Cloudflare and Custom Rules,"Hello everyone,

I'm seeking advice and support from this community regarding persistent DDoS attacks on our streaming platform. Our site hosts a variety of content, including movies, series, animes, eBooks, and live sports streams.

**Situation Overview:**

* **Platform:** Our platform is built on Next.js and hosted on a root server. We use Cloudflare for CDN and security, leveraging Cloudflare Workers to deliver content from Backblaze B2 buckets.
* **Duration of Attacks:** We've been experiencing DDoS attacks for the past six months, typically occurring every 1-2 weeks.
* **Attack Pattern:** Attacks generally last between 0.5 to 2 hours. Recently, they have coincided with our live streams of the Euro Championship 2024 football games, previously targeting our most active times.
* **Type of Attacks:** We are facing both volumetric and application-layer attacks.
* **Targets:** The primary targets include:
   1. [`webpage.com/crew/page/*`](http://webpage.com/crew/page/*)
   2. [`webpage.com/_next/image`](http://webpage.com/_next/image)
   3. [`webpage.com/`](http://webpage.com/)

**Current Security Measures:**

* **WAF and CDN:** We are using Cloudflare’s proxy for website security and content delivery.
* **Custom Rules:** Here are the custom rules we have implemented to mitigate the attacks. They are partially effective, blocking about half of the requests during an attack. For instance, during a recent attack with 37 million requests, 19 million were blocked.

**Custom Rules:**

1. **Country-based Blocking:Action:** BlockplaintextCopy code (ip.geoip.continent in {""AF"" ""AN"" ""SA"" ""T1"" ""OC""} or  [ip.geoip.country](http://ip.geoip.country) in {""AF"" ""AG"" ""AW"" ""BS"" ""BH"" ""BD"" ""BB"" ""BZ"" ""BM"" ""BT"" ""BN"" ""KH"" ""KY"" ""CN"" ""CR"" ""US"" ""CU"" ""DM"" ""DO"" ""ID"" ""AS"" ""KR"" ""NL"" ""EC"" ""SV"" ""GD"" ""GP"" ""GT"" ""HT"" ""HN"" ""IN"" ""ID"" ""IR"" ""IQ"" ""JM"" ""JP"" ""JO"" ""KZ"" ""KP"" ""KR"" ""KW"" ""KG"" ""LA"" ""LB"" ""MY"" ""MV"" ""MQ"" ""MN"" ""MM"" ""NP"" ""NI"" ""OM"" ""PK"" ""PS"" ""PA"" ""PH"" ""PR"" ""QA"" ""VC"" ""SA"" ""SG"" ""LK"" ""SY"" ""TW"" ""TJ"" ""TH"" ""TL"" ""TT"" ""TM"" ""AE"" ""UZ"" ""VN"" ""VI"" ""NL"" ""YE"" ""XX"" ""EG""}  and ip.geoip.asnum in {8075 213230 35540 16276 20860 396982 136907 55933 396319 55990 133478 58519 202053 200350 24940})  
2. **Blocking Unwanted Access to Specific Paths:Action:** BlockplaintextCopy code http.request.uri.path eq ""/\_next/image""  and not http.referer contains ""mekobre.com""  
3. **Blocking Undefined Requests:Action:** BlockplaintextCopy code http.request.uri.path contains ""/tvshow/undefined"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/movie/undefined"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/undefined"" or http.request.uri.path eq ""/assets/avatars/undefined.png"" or http.request.full\_uri contains ""\`undefined\`"" or http.request.full\_uri contains ""undefined"" or http.request.full\_uri contains ""'undefined'"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-D-2.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-D-3.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-M-1.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-M-2.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-M-3.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-M-4.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/publisher/ads-D-1.png"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/api/movies/"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/api/movies?id=undefined"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""undefined"" or http.request.full\_uri contains ""undefined"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""1769"" or http.request.full\_uri contains ""1769"" or http.request.uri.path contains ""/favicon.ico""  

**Current Team Setup:** Our team is small, comprising two developers, two product owners, and two content creators/sales representatives. Being a startup, the attacks seem aimed at hindering our growth.

**Request for Assistance:** We are looking for:

1. Recommendations for additional or improved WAF rules.
2. Tips on modifying our existing rules to be more effective.
3. Any templates or examples of custom rules that have worked well for others in similar situations.
4. General advice on enhancing our DDoS protection and mitigation strategies.

1718526563.0,Creating LinkedIn honeypot profiles for corporate security purposes,"I'm currently managing several cybersecurity projects, and we've been encountering a troubling trend where attackers are using LinkedIn to breach our client's systems. Here are some issues we've been facing:

* Fake recruiters: Impersonators posing as recruiters trying to gather information about our internal systems, presumably to identify vulnerabilities.
* Poaching attempts: Real recruiters persistently attempting to get advance knowledge of future resignations to then try to cold call us offering their services with resumes of potential replacements.
* Market intelligence firms: They offer seemingly attractive assignments (e.g., $500/hour) to get our employees to reveal trade secrets. This is against the employment contract employees sign. We need to know who they are to send cease and desist letters.
* Salespeople: Adding multiple employees to extract small pieces of information, which they then piece together.
* Interview candidates: Trying to get staff to divulge interview questions or methodologies.

Unfortunately, banning staff from using LinkedIn isn't a feasible solution. On the other hand, continuing as is has already led to incidents like phishing attacks and ransomware directly tied to the LinkedIn information harvesting.

We're considering setting up honeypot accounts to draw these malicious actors in, allowing us to profile and do reconnaissance on them. However, we're uncertain about the best way to implement this or if there are other effective solutions.

1718580355.0, A Newbie's Idea on Reuse-Protected Refresh Token Rotation. ,"Hi everyone,

New to cybersecurity! I'm learning about authentication and stumbled upon refresh tokens. [Auth0's article](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/#Refresh-Token-Rotation) mentioned ""refresh token rotation,"" which intrigued me. It seems like the basic idea is keeping track of used tokens to invalidate them on reuse.

However, wouldn't a constantly growing list of used tokens be inefficient? Here's an idea:

* **Database:** Stores nonces (random, unique values) and counts (initially zero).
* **Token Generation:** Encrypt the current count and a random nonce.
* **Token Verification:** Decrypt the token to retrieve the nonce.
   * If the nonce isn't found, the token is invalid (discard).
   * If the count in the token matches the table's count, the token is valid:
      * Increment the table's count.
      * Generate a new token with the updated count (rotation).
   * If the counts differ, the token is invalid (remove nonce & count).

Is this a good approach for refresh token rotation?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dhk9jn/a_newbies_idea_on_reuseprotected_refresh_token/,0

- what other website has valid practice exams that I can take to see if I am ready?

- some questions on the practice exams are really obvious and easy answers revealed just in the question. Does the actual exam have question like that as well?

1718574841.0,Learning paths tips,"Tips on hands-on learning

Hi,
I am a software engineer who is curious on the cybersecurity space, specially offensive security. I have been watching videos and doing some research on Kali tools, HackTheBox and others. I was curious if anyone did a more hands-on practical approach to learning (which would be helpful since that is how I have learned most stuff on my engineering career) that could give me some tips?

My end goal is to get some understanding to hopefully run some bug bounties (money or not we’ll see later on, I know it is not particularly easy to monetize it), and who knows, if I get very into it potentially steering towards cybersecurity for my career. 

Anything helps!",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dhid6f/learning_paths_tips/,3
1718564272.0,I've been looking at disputed CVEs: is it better safe than sorry for vulnerabilities relying on user misuse of packages?,"I come across many disputed CVEs that claim a given vulnerability is only present when say a user does something that is ""known to be insecure"", like entering a password through a CLI parameter option or a buffer overflow if they don't call the initialize and delete function on a C package.

I'm very curious on where the line is on this for things that are bogus vs valid. On one hand there are instances of this that are the nature of languages, like C memory management or not using parameters for SQL calls in a language that allows strings. But at some point, is it valid to say they should not be giving users this option in the first place?

Would love any resources to read up on.",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dhejkg/ive_been_looking_at_disputed_cves_is_it_better/,5
1718569830.0,Does Windows Runtime Security (RASP or eBPF equivalent) exist?,"Hello fellow security engineers,

I was doing some research this weekend and I seem to be struggling to find a solution for Windows runtime security.  Our environment is composed of different types of compute: Windows Ec2, Linux Ec2, EKS, and lambda functions. 

Right now, our cloud security program uses Snyk as our ""left side"" - preventative security layer, by deploying scanners within the CICD pipeline to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced to the environment. We also run Wiz as our ""middle"" - observability layer to detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across our cloud estate. Finally, for the ""right side"" - protection layer, I'd like to deploy a series of different runtime security tools to block malicious activity after something is deployed and running. 

Wiz has a runtime sensor for both Kubernetes and Linux OS, but doesn't have anything for Windows OS (yet?). So, I'm trying to find something to fill this gap. However, I can't seem to find a modern ""runtime security"" tool for Windows OS (EC2) instances other than what I would consider old school anti-malware. Does anything like a RASP or eBPF-like tool exist for Windows? I know eBPF is Linux specific, that's what I'm saying ""ePBF-like"". 

If something like what I'm describing doesn't exist, what would the community recommend? Is something like Cylance good enough?

I appreciate the communities assistance with this!

Thanks.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dhgkbo/does_windows_runtime_security_rasp_or_ebpf/,0
1718570386.0,Triaged data and sent it to wrong client… it gets worse,"I’m a security analyst and I totally sent data to the wrong client. I’m at an ethical dilemma right now bc instead of fixing the mistake right away I deleted the ticket even though the client still received an email. I admit I panicked and tried to resolve the mistake my own way but instead I believe I made it worse by doing this. I honestly think I’m going to lose my job over this given the current climate with the client right now and how they do not see the value in our services. 

Separately, I recently sent a wrong hostname to a client who called it out and I know this seems similar but honestly what I did now is way worse and I feel awful about it. 

Honestly this a series of unfortunate events that happened within the last month and I feel like a complete moron. I do not think this is my best work and know this is not something I regularly do.

I would like to send this information to my management team and I most likely will and will reach out to the client letting them know but any advice from someone with the same experience would be great 😔",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dhgrof/triaged_data_and_sent_it_to_wrong_client_it_gets/,3

For example, recently there was an attack on a semi-big web hotel company in my country. The attack that took down all its customers' sites (ransomware). But the company has not published anything technical on the attack itself (attack vector, vulnerabilities used, timeline, if any known group was behind it, and so on). And I want to know the details. So - is there a place where the attackers typically go and claim the credit and perhaps talk about how they did it?

So I'd like to introduce myself on this subreddit and am looking forward to becoming a part of the community.

To begin with, I am a freelance writer, with a background in Computer Science. Over the years, I have worked with clients across various industries to create content in the form of blogs and articles but recently I have begun to understand that I have a strong interest and passion for tech and cyber security related topics.

I hopped on for two purposes:
One being, engaging with like minded individuals in the community.

And the second one is where I am particularly interested in collaborating with business owners to create optimized and organic content for their websites.

Feel free to hit me up in the comments if you'd like to learn more or if you'd know someone who would be into the service I offer.

Property is not very luxury like you can see on pictures you have on booking.com .
Very cheap and dark design , no practical.
Staff is rude and helpful. Those people are not listening to you . All the time is the same answer- stupid smile. No manager who was trained.
Rooms are very, extremely small , dark with view on the other building wall .
No phone is the room , no turtle no cutlery, no water for guests . Also no ￼ wardrobe. ￼Temperature in the room is extremely cold and you can not make it higher! Also smell in the room is not nice after second day .
I moved after 2nd day to other place .
